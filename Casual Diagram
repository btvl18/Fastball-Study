gg_dag(diag,

```

All of our predictors have an effect on whiff_rate. In addition, spin_rate affects ivb because the spin rate of a ball has an effect on the induced vertical break, or how much a pitch resists the force of gravity and appears to rise, which is partly a result of spin. arm_angle also affects velo because especially from some lower arm angles it's harder to generate a high amount of velocity. We will also have an interaction between arm_angle and ivb, because the angle a pitch appears to be coming from can affect the effectiveness of the vertical break on a fastball.
